## 1. Meta

### Motivation

I want to remember more [of what I read](http://austinkleon.com/2016/03/03/how-to-read-more-2/), so I take notes to share [compressed wisdom](https://sivers.org/2do).

### Purpose

This project logs what I'm reading and how it connects to other sources and ideas.

It also occasionally keeps placeholders for what I want to read.

### Workflow

I read, highlight, and annotate articles mostly on Instapaper.  Alternatively, I use Safari Books Online, Medium, or Genius.  On occasion, I'll write summaries in Pinboard for hashtags.  Feedly is my content inbox with automation via IFTTT for "must read" feeds.  I also skim Hacker News daily.

I recommend two Mac apps for editing Markdown: [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/) for writing, and [Marked](http://marked2app.com/) for previewing and reading.

### Misc.

- I rarely read books [from cover to cover](http://austinkleon.com/2014/10/17/33-thoughts-on-reading/) (blank spots == skipped sections)
- Some books have star ratings at the top, which are recommendations on a 1-5 scale
