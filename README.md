# Notes

A small place to gather thoughts from what I'm learning lately.

> "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."

This project serves three purposes:

1. a log - what I'm reading now
2. a queue - what I want to read in the future
3. an archive - what I've finished reading

## Meta

Articles are read, highlighted, and annotated mostly in Instapaper.  Alternatively, I use Safari Books Online, Medium, or Genius.  On occasion, I'll write summaries in Pinboard for hashtags.  Feedly is my content inbox with automation via IFTTT for "must read" feeds.  I also skim Hacker News daily.

I rarely read books cover-to-cover.  A blank spot indicates a skipped section, while those I plan to read are marked todo.  Star ratings are recommendations on a 1-5 scale.
