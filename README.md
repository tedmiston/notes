## 1. Meta

### Motivation

I want to remember more [of what I read](http://austinkleon.com/2016/03/03/how-to-read-more-2/), so I take notes to share [compressed wisdom](https://sivers.org/2do).

### Purpose

This project logs what I'm reading and how it connects to other sources and ideas.

It also keeps placeholders for what I want to read.

### Workflow

I read articles on Instapaper, and books on a Kindle or Safari Books Online.  I read nonsequentially and typically not [cover to cover](http://austinkleon.com/2014/10/17/33-thoughts-on-reading/) (blank spots == not yet read).  I skim Hacker News daily.

I recommend two Mac apps for working with Markdown: [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/) and [Marked](http://marked2app.com/).
