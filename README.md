## Articles

I read articles with a few tools:

- **Feedly** - incoming bucket for blog posts from friends, startups, tech news, etc.
- **Instapaper** - highlighting and plaintext annotations (currently can't be shared)
- **Genius** - rich and extensive annotations
- **Pinboard** - short, simple tagged summaries saved with my bookmarks
