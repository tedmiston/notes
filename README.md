# Notes

A small place to gather thoughts from what I'm learning lately.

> "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."

Right now this repo serves three purposes:

1. a log of what I've read recently
2. a queue of what I want to read in the future
3. an archive for what I read before I was an annotated reader

## Articles

I read articles with a few tools:

- **Feedly** - incoming bucket for blog posts from friends, startups, tech news, etc.
- **Instapaper** - highlighting and plaintext annotations (currently can't be shared)
- **Genius** - rich and extensive annotations
- **Pinboard** - short, simple tagged summaries saved with my bookmarks

## Books

I rarely read cover-to-cover. If the notes for a section are blank, that's why. If they consist of a `TODO`, then I either haven't processed whether to read that part yet or intend to read it *eventually*.
