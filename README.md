## Meta

### Motivation

I want to remember more [of what I read](http://austinkleon.com/2016/03/03/how-to-read-more-2/), so I take notes to share [compressed wisdom](https://sivers.org/2do).

### Purpose

This project serves a few purposes:

- log what I'm learning from reading books and articles, listening to conference talks and podcasts, etc
- consider how ideas from various sources connect to others
- keep placeholders for what to read / listen / watch in the future
- explore topics for immediate pragmatic value to purely intellectual curiosity

### Workflow

I read articles on Instapaper and books mostly on Kindle or Safari Books Online.  I read nonlinearly and often not [cover to cover](http://austinkleon.com/2014/10/17/33-thoughts-on-reading/) (blank spots == not yet read).  I skim Hacker News and Techmeme weekly.

I recommend two macOS apps for working with Markdown: [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com/) and [Marked](http://marked2app.com/).
