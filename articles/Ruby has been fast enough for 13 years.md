Ruby is already fast enough for most people to do most things.

---

- There's been discussion recently about Ruby being slow
- DHH points out that they ran the first version of Basecamp (and Rails) on a box with 256MB of RAM "used by millions of people that has made tens of millions of dollars in real money"
- "It’s probably more than fast enough for most people doing most things."
- "It’s just that I’m not willing to trade things that are of real, enduring value to get more of a nice-to-have once we’ve long since reached Good Enough."
- "It’s an incredibly affordable luxury for all those businesses where the cost of people, not machines, dominate the balance sheet."
- Good programmers are expensive; computing power is cheap.  Splurge to keep your programmers happy.
