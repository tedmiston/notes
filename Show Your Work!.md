## <a name="preface"></a>A New Way of Operating

> "Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating."
>
> &mdash; <cite>John Cleese</cite>

- artists hate self-promotion -- focus on getting really good & let your audience find you
- *but* make your work discoverable *while* you're working on getting really good
- consistently share tiny pieces of what you're working on, your ideas, and what you're learning -- gain an audience now to use later
- this book is the alternative to self-promotion *for people who hate it*
- [*Steal Like An Artist*](http://austinkleon.com/steal/) was about stealing influence from others; this is about influencing others by letting them steal from you
- imagine spending the majority of your time, attention, and energy practicing your personal interests :thought_balloon:

## <a name="ch1"></a>1. You Don't Have to be a Genius

### Find a scenius
- the lone creative genius is a myth—more common is a group of tastemakers in a scene supporting each other: looking, copying, stealing, contributing
- you don't need smarts / talent, as much as just to be contributing to a scene: share ideas & make quality connections
- **scenius**: "where people go to hang out and talk about the things they care about"
- everyone can contribute *something*, even if you're not a master yet (side thought: is anyone ever *really* a master of anything?)

### Be an amateur
- **amateur**: enthusiast who pursues their work for love; they experiment & follow their whims

> "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few."
>
> &mdash; <cite>[Shunryu Suzuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunry%C5%AB_Suzuki)</cite>

- the gap between mediocre &harr; good is smaller than contributing nothing &harr; something
- retain the amateur's spirit & embrace the uncertainty
- amateurs "use whatever tools they can get their hands on to try to get their ideas into the world"
- commit to learning what you want to learn in front of others
- What voids can you fill?  What are people in your scenius *not* sharing?

### You can't find your voice if you don't use it
- find your voice by using it—talk about the things you love
- Roger Ebert lost his ability to speak, and turned to blogging & social media to write at an aggressive pace
- "If your work isn't online, it doesn't exist.... If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share."

### Read obituaries
> "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked."
>
> &mdash; <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>

- the author reads obituaries every morning to vicariously live near-death experiences—reading what people did is motivation to do something in his own life

## <a name="ch2"></a>2. Think Process, Not Product

### Take people behind the scenes
- process vs. product
- David Bayles and Ted Orland in *Art and Fear*: keep the messy process personal because people care about finished work
- you can bond with your audience by sharing your work-in-progress, day-to-day process, influence, inspirations, tools
- with openness comes potential vulnerability
- put things out there consistently so your audience can connect and be a part of your creative process
- my public reading log is a start, but I need to make it more accessible

### Become a documentarian of what you do
- astronaut Chris Hadfield wanted people to connect with an astronaut's day-to-day life
- he tweeted and YouTubed his normal daily activities, *but in space*
- there's an art to every work and if you present it *"the right way"*, people will be interested
- you can still share process, even if your work is not easily shared, intangible, etc.
- turn the scrap & residue of your process into something for people to see
- keep a work log notebook, scrapbook; take photos, videos, etc. during your process
- documenting & recording your process makes you realize your progress (and gives you material when you're ready to show)

## <a name="ch3"></a>3. Share Something Small Every Day

### Send out a daily dispatch
- building a substantial body of work takes a lifetime -- just start by focusing on days
- "The day has a rhythm."
- once a day, share a little piece of your process, for example:
	- early stage - influences
	- mid-process - methods
	- at launch - scraps or lessons learned
	- post-launch - how your real products are being used
- a resume / portfolio is cool, but a daily dispatch shows what you're working on *right now*
- form doesn't matter: tweet, blog post, photo, video, ... try the new platforms too
- **"Don't show your lunch or your latte; show your work."**
- don't worry about perfect -- see how others react
- we're all busy -- find time
- he works while the world is sleeping & shares while they work (that could work for my ideal lifestyle too)
- if balancing sharing vs. doing work is hard, set a timer

### The "So what?" test
- not a diary -- you're curating every word
- don't put it online if you're not ready for the whole world to see it
- it's great to be open by sharing imperfect & unfinished work, but don't over-share
- "So what?" You're sharing to be helpful to or entertain others
- should I share it?: is it useful or interesting?
	- yes - share
	- no - toss
	- not sure - save for later

### Turn your flow into stock
- "**Flow** is the feed.  It's the posts and the tweets.  It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people you exist.  **Stock** is the durable stuff.  It's the content you produce that's as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today.  It's what people discover via search.  It's what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time."
- social media sites are like public notebooks -- you have to revisit them to see the themes & trends
- once you see the patterns, you can turn bits & pieces into more substance: flow into stock
- ex. ideas in this book: tweets &rarr; blog posts &rarr; book chapters

### Build a good (domain) name
- social networks come & go, but no one can take your own space away from you
- "a blog is the ideal machine for turning flow into stock"
	- thought: possibly use Jekyll on GitHub Pages (though I wouldn't be able to post on mobile)
- his blog has been his gallery, sketchbook, storefront, and led to "everything good that has happened in [his] career"
- your website is for **self-invention**: become the person you want to be, fill it in with your ideas and what you care about
- let it grow & evolve with you over time -- don't abandon it for a shiny, new social network
- a well built domain becomes its own currency

## <a name="ch4"></a>4. Open Up Your Cabinet of Curiosities

### Don't be a hoarder
- **wunderkammern**: "wonder chamber", a room full of remarkable objects showcasing your thirst for knowledge—by including books, jewels, art, skeletons, exotic artifacts, ... they juxtaposed history, nature, and the arts; common 16<sup>th</sup>- and 17<sup>th</sup>-century Europe

[![An example wunderkammern](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Musei_Wormiani_Historia.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Musei_Wormiani_Historia.jpg)
*The 17<sup>th</sup>-century wunderkammern of Danish physician and antiquarian Ole Worm*

- the places we've been and experiences we've accumulated are our mental scrapbooks &rarr; form our tastes &rarr; influence our work
- collection &harr; creation is a spectrum—you're drawing people's attention to the things that you like

> "All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste."
>
> &mdash; <cite>Ira Glass</cite>

- your early work will have potential, but won't be that good yet—you can still share your taste
- Where do you get your inspiration?  What do you collect?  Who's done work that you admire?  Who do you steal ideas from?  Do you have any heroes?
- share your influences to clue people in to your own work & who you are

### No guilty pleasures
- 20 years ago an NYC garbageman [started collecting](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/nyregion/in-new-york-sanitation-dept-garage-an-art-gallery.html) art, paintings, photographs, toys, etc. that others discarded
- artists should *dumpster dive* through other's "trash" & our culture to find inspiration in the things people ignore & the places they don't / won't visit
- the depth & breadth of our influence and ways in which we mix parts of subcultures makes us unique
- share the things you enjoy open & honestly; don't edit too much

### Credit is always due
- credit your sources & influences so your people can dig deeper
- attribution is context: Who made it, when, and why?  Why are you sharing it?  Why should the reader care?  Where can I find more?
- leave breadcrumb trails to how you found the source: *via*, *h/t*
