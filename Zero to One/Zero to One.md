# Zero to One 

Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future
by Peter Thiel with Blake Masters

*As read: November 2014*

## Preface: Zero to One

**PURPOSE**: Why does this book exist?

- learn from what Gates, Zuckerberg, etc. have done; don't just copy them
- copying an existing model takes the world from **1 to n**
- creating something new takes the world from **0 to 1** (what this book is about)
- just fine-tuning today's models leads to a failed future -- innovation is necessary

> "Humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles *technology*."

&nbsp;
> "[T]his book offers no formula for success. The **paradox of teaching entrepreneurship** is that such a formula necessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative."

- based on Thiel's Stanford course [CS183](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?page=0&q=CS+183&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&view=catalog&collapse=&academicYear=20112012), and [renowned notes compiled by Blake Masters](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup)

## 4. The Ideology of Competition

**PURPOSE**: Why do people think competition is something to love?

### "Competition == good" is a pervasive idea 
- **creative monopoly**: "new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator"
- **competition**: "no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival"
- competition is a pervasive ideology in our society that we preach and internalize even though more competition leaves less for us to gain
- our educational system reflects this by using grades to measure how students compete against each other
- students that get the highest marks receive status & credentials, and every student gets taught the same subjects in the same ways
- "elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them"
- Thiel missed out on being awarded a Supreme Court clerkship -- the highest prize for a law student)
- if he had got it, PayPal probably would have never been created
- MBA students love war analogies, but it's really competition, not business, that's like war
- the key to success is [market dominance](http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/30/why-eric-schmidt-doesnt-know-how-google-works/) (e.g., Google's search monopoly)

### Understanding conflict
- 2 models for understanding conflict
- Marx - difference
- Shakespeare - similarity

### Don't focus too much on your competition
- becoming obsessed with your competition is the Shakespeare model
- this is how Apple surpassed Google + Microsoft in market cap
- Square vs. everyone and their brother making a mobile credit card reader
- people that are less susceptible to social conformity become an advantage in the valley
- competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where they don't exist
- ex. the online pet store market (e.g., Pets.com) was overrun w/ competition obsessed w/ defeating each other -- "everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting"

### Fight or merge
- "If you can't beat a rival, it may be better to merge"
- Elon Musk started X.com at the same time and with a very similar feature set to Peter Thiel's PayPal, so they merged to prevent focusing on each other too much before the bubble popped
- fighting is binary: "either don't throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly"
