# Founders at Work
*Stories of Startups' Early Days*<br>
by Jessica Livingston

## Introduction

- This book is about founders' stories in their own words, and the patterns she observed with the goal to inspire future founders
- Many founders were uncertain about starting a company or sure they were doing something big, just sure that _they wanted to fix something broken_ or making something good
- **Determination** is the most important personality trait because you must be able to persevere when nothing goes according to plan, uncertainty, isolation, rejection, etc.
- **Innovation** is something people like abstractly but resist concretely because it differs from what they know
- Web-based email was once dismissed as unpromising

> Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats.
>
> -Howard Aiken

- **Adaptability** is important because most startups don't grow from a brilliant seedling -- they change their ideas
  - PayPal was encryption software
  - Flickr was a game
- Successful founders get rich but care more about changing the world and pride in craftsmanship
- In the business world, startups are *the essence of productivity*
